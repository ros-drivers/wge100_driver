pixfifo_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

fifo_generator_ug175.pdf:
   Please see the core data sheet.

pixfifo.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some

   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

pixfifo.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

pixfifo.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to

   not be edited directly.

pixfifo_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

pixfifo_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
